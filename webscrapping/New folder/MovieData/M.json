Having spent much of my life in Dallas  the tragic events of November 22  1963 have always played a role in my identity as a Texan. President Kennedys assassination that day has carried the added burden of conspiracy theories and politicized commentary ... this in addition to the devastating emotional toll it took on the citizens of the United States. Co-directors Todd Kwait and Rob Stegman focus their attention on The Warren Report  the research conducted by the 7 appointed members of the committee  plus the affiliated attorneys and staff.We see the archival clip of the Boston Symphony announcement of that days assassination  and the reaction of the live audience as the conductor reveals the Funeral March from Beethovens symphony is next up. Its effective as a reminder of the gut-punch felt by the populace  before the filmmakers move towards a more analytical look at the findings by the commission. Vincent Bugliosi then informs us that its the greatest murder case in world history  and also the most important and complex. Bugliosi (now deceased) was the lead prosecutor in the Charles Manson case  and he also acted as the prosecutor in a 1986 televised mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald - an event which led Bugliosi to write a detailed 2007 book entitled \"Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F Kennedy\".Four surviving staff members affiliated with the Warren Commission are interviewed on camera  as are other experts  authors  historians  and investigators. The \"star\" witnesses are Ruth Hyde Paine and Robert Blakey. Ms. Paine was a friend of Marina Oswald  and owned the house where Marina lived at the time of the assassination. Mr. Blakey was Chief Counsel and Staff Director to the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations (1977-79)  which investigated Kennedys death. Among the other key contributors included here are author Patricia Johnson McMillan (\"Marina and Lee\")  Kennedy expert Judge Brendan Sheehan  CIA historian David Robarge  and Sound\/Acoustics investigator Steve Barber.While acknowledging  and not shying away from  the numerous conspiracy theories that have been floated in regards to the assassination  its important to understand that the focus here is on the report filed by the Warren Commission. It could even be categorized as having the goal of proving its accuracy. Its noted that Chief Justice Earl Warren directed everyone associated with the commission that  \"your only client is the truth\". We are informed that the multitude of conspiracy theories have cumulatively accused 12 groups  82 assassins  and hundreds of co-conspirators. The commission interviewed 552 witnesses  and those involved remain adamant that their research and work was neither tainted nor politicized.A high level history lesson is worked in between the interviews  often tying in to the portion of the report being discussed. These segments include: the assassination attempt on General Walker  Oswalds pro-Castro work in New Orleans  the grassy knoll  the pristine bullet  Jack Ruby (including some background on him)  and of course  the Zapruder film ... where the pertinent frames are analyzed. There is an interesting segment on the Police Audio and how it was remarkably released via Gallery Magazine (a publication for adults). Discussion of Operation Mongoose  the CIA plot to overthrow communism in Cuba  including the killing of Fidel Castro may or may not be news to viewers  and there is even mention of Oliver Stones 1991 movie  JFK.Included among those who have been accused of orchestrating the assassination are Cuba  the Soviet Union  organized crime  the FBI  and the CIA. Those involved specifically reference the cover-ups perpetrated by those latter two federal agencies. Did these hinder the investigations and impact the final report? Whether you subscribe to one or more of the conspiracy theories  one would be hard-pressed to not at least acknowledge that the citizenrys distrust of government was amplified during this time  and nothing since has calmed the waters. Kwaits and Stegmans film is undoubtedly the best film breakdown of the Warren Report  though its unlikely to change the minds of those who prefer a conspiracy.
