","933":" I would rate the film \"In Bed with an Elephant: Prime Ministers and Presidents\" a nine on a scale of ten. This film is fairly concise  being only an hour long  but it contains a lot of information and covers a lot of historical ground over the course of that hour. It goes from John A. Macdonald  Canadas first prime minister  meeting with President Grant as a representative of Great Britains interests  on up through the 1930s  where it began to delve into more detail  up until the mid-1980s. This film was produced in 1986. It discussed relationships all over the spectrum  from the friendly and familial conduct between Mackenzie King and Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the rivalry between Diefenbaker and Jack Kennedy to the lopsided personal power dynamics of the era of Lyndon Johnson and Lester Pearson (the election of whom Kennedy directly influenced) and the rift between the two nations caused by the rift between Richard Nixon and Pierre Trudeau. All of these relationships are against a background of industrial production  economic strategies  and conflicts such as the Second World War  the Cuban Missile Crisis  and the Vietnam War. The film did a great job of showing historical images  using still pictures  sound clips  and historical film to emphasize its points. The contrasting relations between the presidents and prime ministers as the years went by is shown quite clearly through images of them together  interviews with historians or  in one case  a former prime minister himself  and the narration provided. Some of the relationships were quite friendly and some were not very friendly at all  and plenty of detail behind these was provided in the form of specific events or meetings between the two heads of government. The music of the film fit the time periods depicted and helped to illustrate the points that the film was trying to make  and the fact that the narrator was shown in a variety of historical places  like Mackenzie Kings study  also helped to bring the history to life  which seems to be the challenge faced by all historical documentaries. The film ends by raising an interesting question (\"Can Canadians choose their nationality?\")  which seemed a bit off and was the only detrimental aspect of the film  in my opinion. Overall  it was quite good. ","934":" A teenage girl is kidnapped by a bizarre theatre cult intent on summoning an ancient witch.

After viewing it  I was curious about the documentary so borrowed one from a friend and watched it last night.The first observation isnt about the DVD but about the fact that Steve Balderson seems to generate either praise bordering on adulation  or criticism that reminds me of total denigration. There sure doesnt seem to be a middle ground for the opinions about this guy and his work.I found Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere to be inspiring. Sure  it is self-indulgent. After all  they made it about themselves  so I doubt any family would deliberately shoot and edit a film that revealed huge flaws  particularly when the objective is to promote their feature film. At least that is what my friend told me... that the documentary was designed to go on a DVD of Firecracker when and if it is ever released as such.Anyway  as I said  Wamego inspired me. While Im an independent film nut (see screen name) I have always wanted to open a coffee house\/caf\u00e9. But Ive always let one thing or another convince me it was a bad idea. And in the process all that has really happened is that Ive gotten older and still havent pursued my dream. After watching Wamego last night  Ive decided it is now or never.I wish there were more to the documentary  like steps and such  but somehow Im going to figure out how to move forward pursuing my dream as determinedly as the Baldersons pursued theirs.You see  I think the real message of Wamego isnt about making an independent film. Its about determination... utter and pure dogged determination. Its about refusing to accept the premise that \"You cant...\" Its about figuring out a way  no matter what the obstacles are. I dont know this family  but my friend does  and he tells me they are pretty genuinely fond of each other. Maybe that is a message too.At any rate  I enjoyed the doc and intend to watch it every time I get bogged down in all the reasons why my dreams will never come true. By God  they can come true!
