The highlight of this series of Argentinian movies curated by director Mat\u00edas Pi\u00f1eiro (\"Viola \" the upcoming \"Princess of France\") just happened to be a French movie that happens to be made  features and is about Argentinian exiles living in Paris. A 35mm theatrical screening is as good as it gets to watch this otherwise-unavailable B&W drama revolving around world-class accordion player Fabian Cortes (Rodolfo Mederos  excellent)  whose diva-like disappearance for days without warning is tolerated by his French girlfriend Danielle (B\u00e9rang\u00e8re Bonvoisin)  his fellow musicians  friends\/artistic collaborators and admirers who regularly come see him play. That Fabian claims to speak to a long-dead patron saint of Argentinian accordion players is shrugged off  even though he swears hes not dreaming or talking to a ghost. Whenever theyre not rehearsing  cooking  waxing philosophically  playing impromptu soccer matches or bitching about politics Fabian and their friends reminisce fondly about a Shangri-La type mythical version of Argentina named Aquilea theyve made up. Then Fabians guerrilla-involved sister Marta (Andrea Livier Aronovich) suddenly shows up  setting in motion a possibility that fills Fabian and his clique with both delight and fear: a chance to go to Aquilea for real.Imagine of Jean-Luc Godard had directed \"Midnight in Paris\" as a B&W series of musical vignettes with a slow-burn conspiracy movie taking shape and youd get a decent (though nowhere near accurate) idea what \"Trottoirs de Saturne\" feels like. At its core this is another love letter to Paris but an intellectual one. The citys welcoming arms to artists the world over is a romantic notion that is shown to only go so far in quelling an artists innate need to reconnect and be loved by a nations power structure that has rejected them. In one of the films highlights Danielle (who is an immigration lawyer and helps Fabians fellow immigrants) confronts her boyfriend about why Argentinian exiles should feel any different than other immigrants who also miss their homelands. That Fabian is willing to turn Danielle into the very exiled life hes rejecting by asking her to go with him to Aquilea speaks volumes about both their characters  which doesnt take away from the movies cheerful embrace of artificiality as a means to tell its rather-unbelievable but rooted-in-reality story.Good supporting performances (including director Hugo Santiago in a prominent non-credited role)  gorgeous B&W cinematography  great music and some honest-to-goodness suspense and tension as the movies final act unfolds makes \"Les Trottoirs de Saturne\" a small avant-garde gem.

","1282":" Phillip Glass The Perfect American is a very interesting work  though its never going to be one of my favourites. Glass music is hypnotic and often beautiful  if occasionally undermining narrative momentum and lacking in variation  and the story is interesting with its take on Walt Disneys later life and sometimes moving  though it has occasions where it lacks dramatic purpose. This production is well worth the watch and fascinating  with much to admire.While the opera may not be for all tastes and it is not the easiest of operas to warm to  there is not much that is wrong with the production itself. There are instances where the choreography movements have a rather stagey slow motion effect that jars with the music  and there are parts that feel a bit draggy and overlong as result of the libretto not always maintaining dramatic purpose.The production does look fantastic  the fusion of mechanical and digital providing a visual feast. The costumes and sets are gorgeous  colourful and rich in surreal atmosphere and the projections are strikingly nostalgic and add to that haunting surrealism  all fitting perfectly with the material. The DVD only adds to the quality  not cheapening it at all  the videography has an unobtrusive and cinematic feel and the picture and sound quality are sharp and clear. A lot of imagination went into the choreography  including the nightmarish bunny rabbits and the malfunctioning Abraham Lincoln  while the very natural acting helps make the drama riveting enough and stunningly and imaginatively nightmarish  regardless of any reservations one has for the opera. The dancers do excellently with it as well.Musically  The Perfect American is exceptionally performed. The orchestral playing is rich in texture  with all the different layers and textures brought out to beautiful effect. It is also always precise  remarkably subtle and dripping in atmosphere. Dennis Russell Davie expertise in Glass music shows in a very dramatically alert and sympathetic performance  which accommodates the singers and drama while maintaining momentum. The performances are very fine across the board  with the resonantly sung and wonderfully acted Walt Disney of Christopher Purves  who brings many layers and likability to an egotistical character  and Donald Kaaschs poignant Dantine standing out. John Easterlins Andy Warhol is like a breath of bright fresh air amidst a story with a dark atmosphere  and Zachary James flexibility and movements for Abraham Lincoln are pretty jaw-dropping and hilarious to see and done so confidently by him. David Soar is appropriately hard-nosed  and Janis Kelly and Pamela Helen Stephen give splendidly colourful performances too. The children are similarly touching.To conclude  a fascinating production with much to admire. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","1283":" A selected group of ambitious young black men are invited into an upstanding Fraternal Society House with great promise.

I did not think I would have to wait 30 years for their next title victory. I went from a young student to entering old age!This was an era where Liverpool would rack up a title win almost every year. If they missed out  then they would win it the next year.This documentary looked at Liverpools decline from 1990. The ongoing toll from the grim Hillsborough disaster from 1989 had a detrimental effect on the club and manager Kenny Dalglish.With Dalglish suddenly resigning. Graeme Souness was the man who people thought could bring stability and a new direction to the club. This was also a time where Manchester United got its act together under Alex Ferguson.Souness could not replicate the success he had with Rangers. It just demonstrated the widening quality between Scottish football and English football.Now Liverpools transfer policy looked shoddy. Other clubs were picking up better players and Liverpools top signings did not live up to their full expectations. Souness also got rid off existing ageing players that still had something to offer.Souness might had won the FA Cup  but the gulf between Man Utd was widening. His interview with the Sun newspaper did him few favours with the fans.Pretty soon  Liverpool were not winning the league  they were also not winning anything else. The last trophy they won in the 20th century was the League Cup in 1995 under manager Roy Evans.When Gerard Houllier became manager  it looked like Liverpool might have turned a corner. There was the cup treble in 2001. A nucleus of talented young prospects such as Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen.Then Houllier had a heart attack and he was never the same afterwards. His transfer targets failed  none of the hyped players went to to become the new Thierry Henry and the club went backwards in the league.In 2004  Rafa Benitez was brought in to manage the club. This was an era where other clubs such as Chelsea had a sugar daddy with an open cheque book. In 2005 there was the miracle of Istanbul but Chelsea were runaway league winners. In hindsight Liverpool were only half way there to win the league in 2005. There would be another 15 years wait.When Hicks & Gillett took over  the club hit its nadir. All because outgoing chairman and owner David Moores did not know how to use Google and do basic checks on the shysters he was selling the club to. This really summed up Liverpool under Moores and Rick Parry.There was a moment where Liverpool were in grave danger of going under. They hit the buffers and went into freefall chaos. As for manager Roy Hodgson and the players bought under his reign. The less said the better.With FSG as new owners there was stability and a plan for the future. Dalglish returned briefly and won the League Cup  a domestic trophy the eluded him in his original tenure. However it was clear that football had moved on and Dalglish was beginning to look a little old fashioned in his tactics. At least he bought Luis Suarez.Brendan Rodgers was a young British manager with ideas. He also had Sturridge and Suarez on fire. It is unfair to single out Gerrards slip for the lost of the title. Liverpools goal scoring abilities masked their defensive frailties.Suarezs hunger to move to Barcelona left Rodgers bereft of ideas and Liverpool falling backwards. One reason being that many of his transfer targets fared poorly. I had Rodgers number as soon as Liverpools failure to make any meaningful progress in European competitions.When Klopp was appointed  I think I just shrugged my shoulders. At least by now it was clear that foreign managers were more successful than the British ones. It was just that whoever the managers was  Liverpools transfer policy seems to be put on a blindfold  spin around a few times and throw a dart in the hope you hit bullseye.For every Suarez  Mascherano  Alonso  Torres. There was a Carroll  Kewell or Benteke or even Konchesky.Klopp sensed that the club was living in its past and the fans were doubters. He wanted to turn them into believers. The big issue was that other clubs still had sugar daddies to bankroll them. Now it was Manchester City engaged in financial doping  able to buy top players. Liverpool had to buy smart.Mohamed Salah was the talisman the club needed. Klopp the serial cup final loser still had disappointments. A loss in the UEFA Cup and Champions League finals. This time Liverpool would return the following season and win the Champions League.They came second to Man City  going toe to toe the whole season and failed to win the Premier League due to their only defeat that season against City. The following season Liverpool almost wrapped it up before Covid struck. Once the season restarted  becoming premier league champions was a formality. There was also a World Club final win.Even at 90 minutes this documentary was a breezy summary. There was very little that was new or incisive. Former managers and players take part. Souness is absent as the conversation always turns to his article in the Sun.Some notable footage was Roy Evans still being upset talking about being pushed out as manager. There is an irate Houllier at a press conference knowing his time is up. The Houllier years now gets glossed over but he won more major trophies in the last 30 years for the club than anyone else.Klopp and current owner John Henry give their thoughts as to why success eventually returned. Under sporting director Michael Edwards  Liverpool have finally bought value players that Klopp would mould into an effective team. Salah was regarded as a Chelsea flop when he was purchased.There was a more in depth article on Liverpool I read in the online Athletic magazine which is behind a paywall. That had more details regarding the clubs decline. Liverpool almost appeared to have become toxic in some quarters after the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters. There was a sense that despite the success the club was somehow cursed.The famed boot room which gave the club continuity also went out of date. It could not keep up in an era of Arsene Wenger with his modern approach to management.Stan Collymore who moved to the club talks about how shocked he was with the diet regime. He thought top clubs like Liverpool would be a centre of excellence. What he saw in the canteen was bacon sarnies in slabs of thick slices of bread with margarine lashed on. Extra sarnie for Neil Ruddock with even more bacon and margarine.Souness tried to modernise. Only to be met with resistance from existing players and enticing new players was not easy. Roy Evans  nice guy but regarded as a soft touch by the players. His era was summed up as the Spice Boys wearing cream suits in the 1996 FA Cup final.I thought this was the kind of deep analysis we would get in this documentary. Instead it was aimed at the general audience with discussions that had been heard several times in the run up to the title win. ","1617":" Kate is about to graduate.

","2158":" Visually interesting and quite funny in all the required scenes  this lovely animated film was created and released in Australia by the Sydney based Eric Porter Studios. His office made TV commercials and seemed to be a successful local animation studio of the 60s specialising also in film credits etc. This was their big cinema release for the 70s... and this epic cartoon had one of the first really wide print releases in the school holidays on about 25 screens in Sydney alone....an unusual event for the time. If you have seen the MGM fantasy style used in INVITATION TO THE DANCE (1956) with the Sinbad sequence  you can get a fairly accurate vision of the lush picture book style of Porter. Some fantasy scenes with the Princess of the piece in MARCO POLO are extremely well created and reflect a few lessons learned from Disneys FANTASIA. Sadly this strong entry into Australias homegrown animated feature film history is not available on video or DVD. Several years ago I attempted to source the negative from Porters widow who was thrilled to see renewed interest but alas the elements required to strike new prints were in disarray. The Film Archive in Canberra had the boxes and will eventually get around to a restoration via a deal they have with Kodak to restore 50 films held on site. The future looks good for this lovely animated film  one of the very few..if almost only feature length cartoons ever crated solely by Australians. It has a Gilbert and Sullivan feel about it..in fact there was an animated MIKADO years ago to which this also might owe a nod. It is also quite funny in a PUFNSTUF kind of way.
