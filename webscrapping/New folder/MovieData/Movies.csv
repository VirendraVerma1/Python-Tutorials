To ensure that his marriage will take place  Harrowby buys a $100 000 insurance policy; if the wedding is called off through no fault of his own  the policy will pay off. Thus  Harrowby will either get rich by marriage or get rich by no marriage. However  the insurance company is loathe to lose money and  to make sure that the wedding takes place  they send an agent  Dick Minot  to fend off any obstacles to the impending nuptials. Of course  while dealing with missing jewels  a fake Lord  and blackmail attempts  Minot falls for the bride to be.A short amusing silent comedy  ""The Reckless Age"" stars handsome English actor Reginald Denny as Minot. Primarily known for his supporting work in such classics as ""Rebecca "" ""Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House "" and ""Anna Karenina "" Denny is the films leading man. He displays startling blue-eyed star quality and a flair for comedy and slapstick; he also displays athleticism  especially when throwing a few punches at his antagonists. Lovely Ruth Dwyer plays Cynthia  the object of Minots affections and Harrowbys designs; Dwyer is quite natural and works well with Denny. As the effete Lord Harrowby  William Astin also performs well  and the rest of the cast  today largely unknown  are quite good. Although an early silent  most of the cast avoid the flamboyant ""grand style "" but they do let loose during an extended slapstick free for all in a newsroom. The cinematography is crisp  and the projection speed is correct; no jumpy images or sped up motion that stereotypes silent films for many.Reginald Dennys career peak was during the silent era  but he cannot be called forgotten  because he appeared in quality films into the 1940s and subsequently worked in television. However  he is largely forgotten as a leading man  and the ""The Reckless Age"" offers viewers an entertaining opportunity to rediscover what made the Englishman a silent star in Hollywood.

Against all the odds  film-maker and Labour voter John Walsh becomes a Conservative Candidate for a seat in a Labour heartland during the British 2010 General Election Campaign. What he uncovers is a place where intimidation and neglect have scarred a town that politics has forgotten. He goes on a quest to find the local absentee Labour Member of Parliament.

What was once a little idea that spawned a tightly-focused documentary has grown into something truly amazing over two years of filming.

In addition to the footage and interviews revolving around the time machine itself  the crew found that simply by delving into the impact of the trilogy an epic journey began to unfold before them. The crew captured countless hours of footage during filming. From Steven Spielberg to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale  to the Sheas and Hollers  and from James Tolkan and Lea Thompson to Christopher Lloyd and Michael J.

Queens at Heart offers a rare glimpse into pre-Stonewall queer life as it takes us to a New York City drag ball and follows the women through their daily lives. They talk about their double-lives-going out as women at night but living as men during the day  and about how they take hormones and dream of ""going for a change."" One talks about avoiding the draft  another about her fiancé and another about the torment of childhood as an effeminate youth. This unique exploitation documentary offers a rare and provocative glimpse into pre-Stonewall queer life.

Having spent much of my life in Dallas  the tragic events of November 22  1963 have always played a role in my identity as a Texan. President Kennedys assassination that day has carried the added burden of conspiracy theories and politicized commentary ... this in addition to the devastating emotional toll it took on the citizens of the United States. Co-directors Todd Kwait and Rob Stegman focus their attention on The Warren Report  the research conducted by the 7 appointed members of the committee  plus the affiliated attorneys and staff.We see the archival clip of the Boston Symphony announcement of that days assassination  and the reaction of the live audience as the conductor reveals the Funeral March from Beethovens symphony is next up. Its effective as a reminder of the gut-punch felt by the populace  before the filmmakers move towards a more analytical look at the findings by the commission. Vincent Bugliosi then informs us that its the greatest murder case in world history  and also the most important and complex. Bugliosi (now deceased) was the lead prosecutor in the Charles Manson case  and he also acted as the prosecutor in a 1986 televised mock trial of Lee Harvey Oswald - an event which led Bugliosi to write a detailed 2007 book entitled ""Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F Kennedy"".Four surviving staff members affiliated with the Warren Commission are interviewed on camera  as are other experts  authors  historians  and investigators. The ""star"" witnesses are Ruth Hyde Paine and Robert Blakey. Ms. Paine was a friend of Marina Oswald  and owned the house where Marina lived at the time of the assassination. Mr. Blakey was Chief Counsel and Staff Director to the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations (1977-79)  which investigated Kennedys death. Among the other key contributors included here are author Patricia Johnson McMillan (""Marina and Lee"")  Kennedy expert Judge Brendan Sheehan  CIA historian David Robarge  and Sound/Acoustics investigator Steve Barber.While acknowledging  and not shying away from  the numerous conspiracy theories that have been floated in regards to the assassination  its important to understand that the focus here is on the report filed by the Warren Commission. It could even be categorized as having the goal of proving its accuracy. Its noted that Chief Justice Earl Warren directed everyone associated with the commission that  ""your only client is the truth"". We are informed that the multitude of conspiracy theories have cumulatively accused 12 groups  82 assassins  and hundreds of co-conspirators. The commission interviewed 552 witnesses  and those involved remain adamant that their research and work was neither tainted nor politicized.A high level history lesson is worked in between the interviews  often tying in to the portion of the report being discussed. These segments include: the assassination attempt on General Walker  Oswalds pro-Castro work in New Orleans  the grassy knoll  the pristine bullet  Jack Ruby (including some background on him)  and of course  the Zapruder film ... where the pertinent frames are analyzed. There is an interesting segment on the Police Audio and how it was remarkably released via Gallery Magazine (a publication for adults). Discussion of Operation Mongoose  the CIA plot to overthrow communism in Cuba  including the killing of Fidel Castro may or may not be news to viewers  and there is even mention of Oliver Stones 1991 movie  JFK.Included among those who have been accused of orchestrating the assassination are Cuba  the Soviet Union  organized crime  the FBI  and the CIA. Those involved specifically reference the cover-ups perpetrated by those latter two federal agencies. Did these hinder the investigations and impact the final report? Whether you subscribe to one or more of the conspiracy theories  one would be hard-pressed to not at least acknowledge that the citizenrys distrust of government was amplified during this time  and nothing since has calmed the waters. Kwaits and Stegmans film is undoubtedly the best film breakdown of the Warren Report  though its unlikely to change the minds of those who prefer a conspiracy.

In 1863  Abraham Lincoln proved himself a master of a new frontier--not on the battlefields of the Civil War  but in his ""high-tech"" command center  the War Department Telegraph Office. The telegraph was the ""Internet"" of the nineteenth century  and it gave Lincoln powers of command  communications  and control never before exercised by a commander-in-chief. He used this new technology to connect the country to him--receiving nearly live dispatches via telegraph from his generals in the field and sending out his plans for the nation faster and with more clarity than ever before. The results of Lincolns pioneering experiment in electronic leadership would ultimately lead to the fields of Gettysburg. There  one battle turned the tide of the Civil War--and became the setting for the 272 words of Lincolns Gettysburg Address  the speech that recast the American ideal as a national creed.
